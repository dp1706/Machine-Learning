## Machine-Learning


### Intro
       
 >  Hy , Dwarka prasad bairwa is here. This is my Machine Learning Assignment Repository. In these Assignment I have used  python library like `pandas` `numpy` `scipy` `matplotlib` `seaborn` and other.I used `python3`
   
  > For installing python library i used 
  ```python
  #For python3
  !pip3 install `library-name`
  
  #For python
  !pip install `library-name`
  
  ```
> Here All code are in `Google colob` or `Jupyter-Notebook`
